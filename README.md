# Neural Network for Odd Number Prediction

A simple neural network implementation in TypeScript that predicts whether a number is odd or even. This is a proof-of-concept project demonstrating neural networks for binary classification.
This project is just for fun, don't expect anything useful from this.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @n0uur/is-odd-ai
```

## Usage

```typescript
import isOdd from "@n0uur/is-odd-ai";

const result = isOdd(123);
console.log(result); // true
```
